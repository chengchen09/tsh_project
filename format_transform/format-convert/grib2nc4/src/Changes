		new: 264:30420217:d=2004021912:TMIN:2 m above ground:66-72 hour fcst:

		    wrong, used 2's complement to store integer rather than signed number.
		    NCEP operations knows of the problem but can't fix it because of 
		    downstream software.
		changed -prob: prob>N to prob >N, prob<N prob <N, prob>N <N to prob =N
		-lev0 .. handle factions of a PV unit in control file
v0.1.7.8c  1/2009 (internal)

			will print UNDEF values lat/lon = 999 if request
			is outside the input domain and latlon->ij code is

		Manfred Schwarb: some cleanup patches,
		lev0 & hybrid layers:
			old hybrid level: hlevN -> hyN
			old hybrid layer: hlN_M -> hyN_M
			old hybrid layer: hlNp5 -> hyNp5
			old scheme was confusing and inconsistent
			done because h-ell looks like h-one
